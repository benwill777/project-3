### Future versions
In version 2 I would like to add User Auth., with full crud on all of my models. I would like my styling to be complete, my user interface to be seamless.
### Major Lessons Learned
From project 3, i learned to stick to my user stories, treat the planning phase of the project with the same respect as the actual code. In addition, I further gained knowledge of how to target specific needed Google search results, and how to filter out poor search returns. (outdated stackoverflow)
